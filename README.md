# DirectedGraphSearch
Finds shortest distace between two points on a weighted graph
## Approach
I used an adjacency matrix to represent such a graph with the weighted values in the corresponding slots. Then dijkstra's algorithm was used to traverse the matrix and print out the total weight before reaching the goal. A separate function was implemented to print out the shortest path from start to finish.
